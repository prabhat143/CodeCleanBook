### There Will Be Code
Nonsense: Programmers won't be needed because business people will generate programs from specifications. The level of abstraction of our programming languages will increase but there will be code. Well, specified requirements can act as executable tests for our code.

### Bad Code
Bad code can bring a company down. There are no excuses for bad code, no reasons: your boss does not give you time, you want to finish faster to get more backlog stories finished... I will clean it later... Later equals never.

### The Total Cost of Owning a Mess
It will drive productivity ever further toward zero.

### The Grand Redesign in the Sky
If you decide to redesign your system, with a different team, maybe you will get:
- Two teams in a race
- Years of development are necessary to provide the same features
- People will leave the company and the redesign becomes messy for newer members and they want to redesign it again.

### Attitude
Why does this happen to code? requirements? stupid managers? schedules ?? No.
It is all about unprofessionalism. Most managers want good code. We have to help them to understand the risks of bad code.

### The Primal Conundrum
The only way to go fast is to get the code as clean as possible.

### The Art of Clean Code?
Writing clean code requires discipline. We need to work hard to get "code sense".

### What Is a Clean Code?
- Broken windows concept: looks like nobody cares about it
- Code without test is not clean.
- Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.
- No duplication, one thing, expressiveness, tiny abstractions.
- It does pretty much as you expected: obvious, simple and compelling
- Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.

### The Boy Scout Rule
Leave the campground cleaner than you found it. The clean up does not have to be something big.
